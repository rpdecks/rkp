## [Babysitter App](https://babysitter-front.herokuapp.com/)

An interface for those with children and local child care providers, Babysitter aims to connect 
those in need with those who care. Parents can schedule and post babysitting jobs online and, find 
qualified, vetted, and experienced babysitters in their area. Browse caregiver profiles, read 
reviews, and communicate directly with caregivers to find the best one for the job.

Caregivers can create a profile, browse, and apply for available babysitting jobs. Over time, 
caregivers can build a portfolio of completed work with positive reviews to build brand and 
reputation in their community enabling them to secure more jobs and higher pay.
