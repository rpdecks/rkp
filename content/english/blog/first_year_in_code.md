# My first year in code... the takeaways

Year one in code is like diving into an ocean of things to know/learn and drinking from a fire hydrant. This is my attempt, to look into the rear view mirror, and crystallize my learning into a list (perhaps mainly for myself) of the key takeaways that helped me from a couple angles. Maybe this could be helpful to others.

## Technical

1. Learning Git
   I was asked by a teammate how to best help a new learner with Git. I hate to be the guy that throws a big fat book at you, but that's what helped me the most. I got a base level of training in bootcamp how to branch and commit but that was about it. When I joined a team and started having to live/move about on a team in the Git flow of work I got desperate. It's so hard to cook a meal if you only have a whisk and a laddle. You need more tools. I got stuck for hours and trying to do basic things. Of course Google is your friend, always... but when you know so little about how Git works I found that I really needed to just take the dive and spend a week/month to get my arms around the basics of Git. For me, Googling handy littls tricks doesn't seem to stick until I have a letter better understanding of the lay of the Git land to hang them them on.

So, I recommend the book ["Pro Git"](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2). I saw it at my boss's house and when he offered to get me something, I asked for a copy of that one. In particular, the sections on Basics, Branching, and Tools.

A few of my favorite things:

- interactive rebasing
- cherry picking
- git checkouts from other branches
- git stashing

1. Communication
   I wrote another blog post called ["The Better Ask"](https://www.robertkevinphillips.com/blog/structuring-requests/) and the funny thing is, I am and was terrible at it all along. I had to learn this first hand in year one. There were a few basic things I didn't understand that make it particularly hard to work in code and communicate well.

- Finite capacity
  Often the kinds of things we work on are very particular/contextual, and require intense focus and concentration. We are limited, mortal beings who can only hold onto so much infor and context at at ime. I had to learn that the people I ask for help are such and have their own things they are working on.
  If I want their help, I need to deeply internalize that and coordinate with that to make it as easy and painless as possible for them to help me. If they have to muster all their strength and sleuth their way through my questions to solve my problems, the ask is too much. I won't get much help.

- Myopia
  When we are so focused on a task we are working on, our view can become so focused and narrow that our view of other things becomes blurry. Like when we are reading for hours and then look up at the horizon and can't see so well. When we work on a problem intensely and then are forced to explain it to someone, it's often very hard to do that because we are so immersed in its context we don't realize others don't know about it. Anyhow, it's a real exercise to back all the way out of it and explain to another and bring them, effectively, into the important parts of a problem's context so they can help us.

  "Help me... help you." - Jerry Maguire :)

- Context switching
  When we finally get deeply into a problem and all the context it includes... and we are trying to solve a problem... if you're like me that's when it's the absolute worst time to ask me something. First of all, it takes a lot to get to that place so it really upsets me to get distracted. But also, my brain experiences inertia. When it's barreling down a path chasing a solution, it's really hard for my brain to stop thinking about that and listen anything else, much less concentrate on it.

1. Development workflow
   I needed to learn how my team, particuarly our leadership, collaborates to get work done. We are a small developing, upstart kind of team with new devs. So our leadership was building a culture on the one hand, and refining it as we go. So, we needed lots of coaching to arrive a similar mental model which meant we needed to talk about it a lot, and then talk about it again.

   This meant learning how to work so that a feature request didn't develop into a bear of a thing that only one of us really understood or worked on. It meant learning how to break tasks down into smaller pieces and delegate them. It meant code review and documentation. It meant learning to focus on the task at hand and avoid scope creep.

1. Testing
   I learned how to write bad tests, then good tests, and then to love tests. I left code school without know anything really about testing. It was important to my team's leadership so I dove into it, Cypress & RSpec particularly. It wasn't hard to understand why good tests helped us. We shipped bugs. Our client was growing. That had to stop.
   I wrote any test at first because I didn't understand more than that. I was learning how Cypress worked and our app at the same time. Like all devs, a year later I am horrified by my first tests because I have learned so much. I'm getting better and so is my team.
   The biggest learning though? We write tests to control cost. I never realized that or looked at it through that lens before. Think about that though... I'll try to write another post about that detail alone.

1. Resourcefulness
   There is an ocean of stuff to know. It's hard to know where you will focus I think because it is often driven by the project you end up on, the business driving it, and the problems we run into. So I'm learning to expect that and I'm getting better starting from scratch, knowing nothing, and getting to what I need to know. There is no shortcut to or for experience.
   I should write a post about it but some key interesting things I've learned:

- using better key words
- Github issues pages
- Upvotes
- find on page
- Api reference documentation
- Code sandboxes
- Storybook

## Psychological/emotional

1. Initimidation
   Often I'm afraid of new tech... thinking it's going to be too hard to understand or use. After several iterations, I'm learning that learning the new tech is like learning the "old tech" I learned before. It's just a matter of embracing the process of starting from scratch with something (like Pro Git above).
   I need a process for doing that... I should blog about that too. Things like, use the Getting Started page. Spend the time to learn the new tech's terminology and get the right mental model about it. Avoid skimming on that part. Use a sandbox to play with it so as to minimize the complexity around getting it working and maninuplating it.
