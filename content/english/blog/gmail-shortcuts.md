Why should I care about keyboard shortcuts? They are neat, but are the worth my time? Are they just for the super techie programmers?

Give me just a few minutes to make the case for taking the time to learn some and then show you some "low-hanging fruit" that can save you time today and impress your friends.

Why care about shortcuts or take time to try to learn them?
In this post, we are just talking about Gmail. How much time do you spend each day checking email? The average full-time worker spends 28% of the work day reading and answering email. This translates to rougly 2.6 hours a day and around 120 messages [McKinsey study via hbr.org](https://hbr.org/2019/01/how-to-spend-way-less-time-on-email-every-day#:~:text=The%20average%20professional%20spends%2028,120%20messages%20received%20per%20day.).

An average person getting a 10% faster/better at Gmail alone could regain **~3744 minutes of their work year. That's over 62 hours per work year!** What if I were to tell you, what I'm sharing here made me closer to 25% faster? Well, I honestly think it was more than that. I caught the bug and found all the program I used the most and started to attack them too.

The biggest hurdle for me to care about or invest in mastering shortcuts was this one thought I encountered while working... "I know there is a shortcut for this or a faster way to do this... _pause_..." I could just Google it and use it here... but by the time I do all that, I could just have used the mouse or typed it all out, etc.

**Pick up this thought:**  
While that may be true this time, if you can learn something that will save 1 second on something you do 10,000 times a year... that's almost 3 hours/year. It's money in the bank. It's actually more expensive to miss this chance to look it up, hands-on apply it, and gain some muscle memory. Trust me, after you do that a few times it will be engrained and a few more, second nature.

1. Time is money
1. Time is family and other things you care about
1. Repuation

- if you manage email efficiently and well, your customer and coworkers will know and you will profit

1. Less frustration

Disclaimers:

1. many ways to optimize your inbox email flow mgt like filtering, forwarding, aliases, promo/social inboxing, boomerang, etc not this post

How to enable shortcuts:
settings gear top right
see all settings
keyboard shortcuts (top menu bar to end on right for me)

Most useful Gmail Shortcuts:

1. ? to see keyboard shortcuts overlaid on screen, esc to close

- use this feature as often as you can until muscle memory...
- pervasive thought... it will take me more time to look up the shortcut that to just do it the long way or use a mouse... consider 1000x per year saving 2 seconds each time.

2. j || k for up/down
1. shift + # to delete
1. / to search
1. g + l to search for folder labels
1. - - r, a, u to select messages
1. shift + u to mark read
1. shift + i to mark unread

1. x to select
1. e to archive
1. v to move
1. s to star
1. u to nav back to threadlist
1. l to apply label

1. d to draft in new window
1. c to compose in this window
1. Cmd shift c to CC
1. Cmd shift b to CC

advanced searching:

1. set up search engine in Chrome

- settings > search engine on left > manage search engines > Add
- https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#search/%s
- give simple name to type
- new tab... gmail tab then type search is:unread in:inbox
