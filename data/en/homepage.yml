  description : "An industrial & systems engineer turned full-stack web developer. As a husband and father of three, I am a curious and determined craftsman..."
  content : 
    "After 8 years in the HVAC industry consulting with design engineers, contractors, and building owners, a deep inward turn led me to Bible school and into 10 years of collegiate ministry. I feel this has produced in me a unique blend of technical prowess and ability to work with very diverse groups of people from varying backgrounds both technical and cultural.  
    My whole life has centered around teams, tech, growth, competition, and the mastering of craft. Growing up in youth team sports, diving into mechanics, a degree in engineering, and years in industry... passion, curiosity, and drive have been the theme. Over and over I'm taken with curiosity and desire to understand and master new things like classic cars, specialty coffee roasting, craft brewing, home renovation, lawn care, fishing, and dog training to name a few. Professionally this has included code, development, construction, people, and cause.
    I am now looking to partner with a company to create powerful tech solutions to challenging real-world problems. I'm eager to be in an environment where teamwork, learning, stretching, and mutual growth are priorities."

        # "Robert is a newcomer to software development; by training he is an engineer (a Ramblin Wreck from Georgia Tech, like me). I have known him for 15 years and have worked alongside him in many capacities.  

        # As a lifelong developer myself, I told him many times, 'If you ever come into development work, you will do well.' Well, that prophecy is now ripening to fruition, and to put it mildly, I called it.  

        "There are two types of people who graduate from software bootcamps.  
        The first kind are those who feel like they have been given something, that they have acquired something. They immediately begin to search for jobs and roles that fit their newly acquired skillset.  
        The second kind are those who realize that what they have been given is a set of keys to continually unlock new tools, languages, and approaches to building things. They don't feel like they have arrived; they feel that they are just beginning. The main thing they feel they have been given is the courage to figure things out. They know there is no such thing as magic, when you need to understand or master something, you just patiently grind through docs, stackoverflow, your community, and every other resource the internet has. The second kind has a very observable growth curve and is worth far more than the first kind.  
        Robert is the second kind."

      designation : "Elder of Church in Athens"
      content : "Robert worked for The Church in Athens, Inc. for the past 7 years. During that time, he has been a self-starter and a productive contributor to team efforts. In addition to having a high degree of integrity and a friendly personality, he is one of those rare individuals who can both follow instructions and take initiative, as appropriate. He is strong in time management and his competence extends beyond the skills for which he was originally hired.  
      
      
      Robert managed five individuals on a campus outreach team at the University of Georgia. Daily he would lead a strategic discussion with his team to evaluative and focus their labor. Robert also joined team efforts to carry out multiple, weekly campus related gatherings with up to 30 UGA students in each. The ease with which he collaborates with others helped these gatherings run smoothly and efficiently. Robert also helped spearhead three regional conferences held annually. These were very large conferences with up to 200 participants in each. His meticulous attention to detail left nothing to chance and ensured that every need of the conference was met in full. In addition, all the students Robert mentored over the years were much appreciative of the genuine concern and shepherding care they received from him."

      content : "Robert is always looking to learn something new or develop a new skill. As a software developer, curiosity and scrappiness are two highly desired traits, and Robert has both in spades. At Flatiron School, I had the pleasure of working with Robert on building a nurse dispatching web application from the ground up. Working together was truly a pleasure, as we were able to tackle many difficult problems including Mapbox API configuration and difficult frontend data flow. If you're looking for someone with intelligence, perseverance, and high work ethic, Robert would make a great addition to your team."

      He's a big-picture thinker, helping me see beyond the day to day. But he also knows how to get into the details of his work in order to solve a problem. Overall, he would be a great asset to any organization, and I would gladly work with him again in the future."

      He knows how to push people in a positive way. In many ways and through much practical coaching, he helped me step out of my comfort zone and grow. He is honest, frank and very understanding, qualities I find made it easy and a great pleasure to work with him."
