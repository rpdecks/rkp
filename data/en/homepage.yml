  title : "About Me"
  description : "An industrial & systems engineer turned full-stack web developer. As a husband and father of three, I am a curious and determined craftsman..."
  content : 
    "After 8 years in the HVAC industry consulting with design engineers, contractors, and building owners, a deep inward turn led me to Bible school and into 10 years of collegiate ministry. I feel this has produced in me a unique blend of technical prowess and ability to work with very diverse groups of people from varying backgrounds both technical and cultural.  
    My whole life has centered around teams, tech, growth, competition, and the mastering of craft. Growing up in youth team sports, diving into mechanics, a degree in engineering, and years in industry... passion, curiosity, and drive have been the theme. Over and over I'm taken with curiosity and desire to understand and master new things like classic cars, specialty coffee roasting, craft brewing, home renovation, lawn care, fishing, and dog training to name a few. Professionally this has included code, development, construction, people, and cause.
    I am now looking to partner with a company to create powerful tech solutions to challenging real-world problems. I'm eager to be in an environment where teamwork, learning, stretching, and mutual growth are priorities."
